        I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Robotics and Automation, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Multimedia University, Melaka, Malaysia. With over 19 years of experience in academia, I focus on cutting-edge research in Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics, and their applications in real-world scenarios.

        My research expertise spans across multiple domains including Anomaly Detection, Object Detection, Healthcare IoT, Renewable Energy systems, and Robotics Control. I have published over 78 journal papers in high-impact WoS/Scopus indexed journals, along with 38 conference papers and 3 books/chapters.

        I am passionate about developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, particularly in healthcare, smart systems, and sustainable energy. I welcome collaborations with researchers, industry partners, and students who share similar interests.
