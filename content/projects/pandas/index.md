This innovative project combines fuzzy logic with complex event processing techniques to predict network faults before they occur. The system analyzes real-time network data streams, identifies patterns, and provides early warnings of potential failures, enabling proactive maintenance and improved network reliability. The research resulted in a copyright registration for the developed technology.
